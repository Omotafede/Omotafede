## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Oluwatobi Omotafede Okafor, mostly referred to as Omotafede. 
- âš¡ I'm a Cybersecurity Specialist, with a specialty in Application security, API security and Ethical hacking as a whole from the purview of a Red Teamer. Personally, I love  IAM especially as it relates to defence, the vibe of the SOC environment as it tends to attacks amnd prevention, the emerging technologies of the cloud and how secure it can be, the intricacies of AI and its implications for us in the security sector and the beauty that is Digital Forensics and the acccompanying artifacts.
-ðŸŒ± During the day, you will find me educating minds and preaching the gospel of Cybersecurity and at night, you will, more often than not, find me hacking away at applications and within environments to figure if it is vulnerable and just how much.
